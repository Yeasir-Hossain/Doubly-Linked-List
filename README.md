# Doubly Linked List Implementation in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of a doubly linked list with various operations. The project utilizes a menu-driven interface for easy interaction. The doubly linked list structure consists of nodes containing information such as roll number and name.

## Features

- **Insertion Operations:**
  - Insert at the beginning of the list.
  - Insert at the end of the list.
  - Insert before a specified record.
  - Insert after a specified record.

- **Deletion Operations:**
  - Delete the entire list.
  - Delete the first record.
  - Delete the last record.
  - Delete a specific record.

- **Search Operation:**
  - Find the position of a record based on the name.

- **Traversal:**
  - Display the full list.

## Usage

1. **Insert Data:**
   - Choose option 1 and specify the number of records to enter. Follow the prompts to input roll numbers and names.

2. **Insertion Operations:**
   - Options 2 to 5 allow you to insert records at different positions in the list.

3. **Deletion Operations:**
   - Options 6 to 9 enable you to delete records or the entire list.

4. **Search Operation:**
   - Use option 10 to find the position of a record based on the name.

5. **Traversal:**
   - Option 11 displays the full list.

6. **Quit:**
   - Select option 12 to exit the program.

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the program using a C++ compiler, and run the executable.

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o LinkedList
./LinkedList
```

# Example

For a quick start, you can use the following example:

1. **Insert a few records:**
   - Choose option 1 and specify the number of records you want to enter. Follow the prompts to input roll numbers and names.

2. **Perform insertion and deletion operations:**
   - Use options 2 to 9 to insert records at different positions, delete specific records, or the entire list.

3. **Search for a record:**
   - Choose option 10 to find the position of a record based on the name.

4. **Display the full list:**
   - Choose option 11 to see the complete list.

## Note

This program is a basic implementation of a doubly linked list. Feel free to enhance and modify it according to your requirements.
